# Table of Contents
[[TOC will be inserted here]]

-------

# 1 Introduction

The text in this section may all be replaced, but the following three sections (1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) are required for OASIS publications. Section 1.1 (IPR Policy) must not be changed by the TC. Section 1.2 (Terminology) may be modified to include other terminology-related information used in this specification. Section 1.3 (Normative References) should be modified to include additional references, as needed. Section 1.4 (Non-Normative References) is not required, but should be modified to include additional references, as needed.

Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named openc2-file.md):

pandoc -f gfm -t html openc2-file.md -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css --toc --toc-depth=5 -s -o openc2-file.html --metadata title="Title of Specification Version 1.0"

OASIS staff are currently using pandoc 2.6 from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.6.

This also requires the presence of a .css file containing the HTML styles (like styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css).

Note this command generates a Table of Contents (TOC) in HTML which is located at the top of the HTML document, and which requires additional editing in order to be published in the expected OASIS style. This editing will be handled by OASIS staff during publication.
A TC may use other ways to generate HTML from markdown, which may generate a TOC in a different way.

## 1.1 IPR Policy
This specification is provided under the [Non-Assertion](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode) Mode of the [OASIS IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established. For information on whether any patents have been disclosed that may be essential to implementing this specification, and any offers of patent licensing terms, please refer to the Intellectual Property Rights section of the TC's web page ([https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php)).

## 1.2 Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)] and [[RFC8174](#rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## 1.5 Typographical Conventions
Keywords defined by this specification use this `monospaced` font.
```
    Normative source code uses this paragraph style.
```
Text following the special symbol (Â«) â an opening Guillemet (or French quotation mark) â within this specification identifies conformance statements. Every conformance statement is separated from the following text with the special end symbol (Â») â a closing Guillemet, and has been assigned a reference that follows that end symbol in the format [CSAF-section#-local#].

Some sections of this specification are illustrated with non-normative examples introduced with "Example" or "Examples" like so:

*Examples:*
```
    Non-normative examples also use this paragraph style but preceded by the text "Example(s).
```

All examples in this document are non-normative and informative only.

All other text is normative unless otherwise labeled e.g. like:

Non-normative Comment:
>This is a pure informative comment that may be present, because the information conveyed is deemed useful advice or common pitfalls learned from implementer or operator experience and often given including the rationale.

## 1.6 Some markdown usage examples

**Text.**

Note that text paragraphs in markdown should be separated by a blank line between them -

Otherwise the separate paragraphs will be joined together when the HTML is generated.
Even if the text appears to be separate lines in the markdown source.

To avoid having the usual vertical space between paragraphs,  
append two or more space characters (or space-backslash) to the end of the lines  
which will generate an HTML break tag instead of a new paragraph tag \
(as demonstrated here).

### 1.6.1 Figures and Captions

FIGURE EXAMPLE:
<note caption is best placed ABOVE figure, so a hyperlink to it will actually display the figure, instead of rendering the figure off the screen above the caption. The same placement should be used for table captions>

###### Figure 1 -- Title of Figure
![image-label should be meaningful](images/image_0.png) (this image is missing)

###### Figure 2 -- OpenC2 Message Exchange
![message exchange](images/image_1.png)


### 1.6.2 Tables

#### 1.6.2.1 Basic Table
**Table 1-1. Table Label**

| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Item 1 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 2 | Something |
| Item 3 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 4 | text |

#### 1.6.2.2 Table with Three Columns and Some Bold Text
text.

| Title 1 | Title 2 | title 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| something | something | something else that is a long string of text that **might** need to wrap around inside the table box and will just continue until the column divider is reached |
| something | something | something |

#### 1.6.2.3 Table with a caption which can be referenced

###### Table 1-5. See reference label construction

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **content** | Message body as specified by content_type and msg_type. |

Here is a reference to the table caption:
Please see [Table 1-5 or other meaningful label](#table-1-5-see-reference-label-construction) 


### 1.6.3 Lists

Bulleted list:
* bullet item 1.
* **Bold** bullet item 2.
* bullet item 3.
* bullet item 4.

Indented or multi-level bullet list - add two spaces per level before bullet character (* or -):
* main bullet type
  * Example second bullet
    * See third level
      * fourth level

Numbered list:
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

Left-justified list without bullets or numbers:
To list multiple items without full paragraph breaks between items, add space-backslash after each item except the last.

### 1.6.4 Reference Label Construction

REFERENCES and ANCHORS
- in markdown source, format the Reference tags as level 6 headings like: `###### [RFC2119]`
###### [RFC2119]
Bradner, S., "Key words ..."

- reference text has to be on a separate line below the tag

- format cross-references (citations of the references) like: `see [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)]`  
"see [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)]"  
(note the outer square brackets in markdown will appear in the visible HTML text)

- The text in the Reference tag (following ###### ) will become an HTML anchor using the following conversion rules:  
-- punctuation marks will be dropped (including "[" )  
-- leading white spaces will be dropped  
-- upper case will be converted to lower  
-- spaces between letters will be converted to a single hyphen

- The same HTML anchor construction rules apply to cross-references and to section headings.  
-- Thus, a section heading like "## 1.3 Normative References"  
-- becomes an anchor in HTML like `<a href="#13-normative-references">`  
-- referenced in the markdown like: see [Section 1.3](#13-normative-references)  
-- (in markdown: `"see [Section 1.3](#13-normative-references"`)  
-- similar HTML anchors are also used in constructing the TOC

### 1.6.5 Code Blocks

Text to appear as an indented code block with grey background and monospace font - use three back-ticks before and after the code block).

Note the actual backticks will not appear in the HTML format. If it's necessary to display visible backticks, place a back-slash before them like: \``` .

```
{   
    "target": {
        "x_kmip_2.0": {
            {"kmip_type": "json"},
            {"operation": "RekeyKeyPair"},
            {"name": "publicWebKey11DEC2017"}
        }
    }
}
```

Text to be highlighted as code can also be surrounded by a single "backtick" character: 
`code text`

## 1.7 Page Breaks
Add horizontal rule lines where page breaks are desired in the PDF - before each major section
- insert the line rules in markdown by inserting 3 or more hyphens on a line by themselves:  ---
- place these before each main section in markdown (usually "#" - which generates the HTML `<h1>` tag)

-------

# 2 Design Considerations
The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) is a language to exchange Security Advisories formulated in JSON.

Non-normative comment:

>The term Security Advisory as used in this document describes any notification of security issues in products of and by providers. Anyone providing a product is considered in this document as a vendor, i.e. developers or maintainers of information system products or services. This includes all authoritative product vendors, Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs), and product resellers and distributors, including authoritative vendor partners.
A security issue is not necessarily constraint to a problem statement, the focus of the term is on the security aspect impacting (or not impacting) specific product-platform-version combinations. Information on presence or absence of work-arounds is also considered part of the security issue.
This document is the definitive reference for the language elements of CSAF version 2.0. The encompassing JSON schema file noted in the Additional Artifacts section of the title page shall be taken as normative in the case a gap or an inconsistency in this explanatory document becomes evident.
The following presentation in this section is grouped by topical area, and is not simply derivative documentation from the schema document itself. The information contained aims to be more descriptive and complete. Where applicable, common conventions are stated and known common issues in usage are pointed out informatively to support implementers of document producers and consumers alike. The section SCHEMA_SECTION_NUMBER Schema derives from the JSON schema itself as a service for the reader.

Â« From a high-level perspective, any Security Advisory purported by a CSAF version 2.0 adhering JSON text document MUST provide the document member with at least the following five properties defined: `csaf_version`, `title`, `publisher`, `type`, and `tracking`. Â» [CSAF-2-1]

This minimal required information set does not provide any useful information on products, vulnerabilities, or security advisories. Thus, any real-world Security Advisory will carry additional information as specified in SCHEMA_SECTION_NUMBER section Schema.

Care has been taken, to design the containers for product and vulnerability information to support fine-grained mapping of security advisories onto product and vulnerability and minimize data duplication through referencing.
The display of the elements representing Product Tree and Vulnerability information has been placed in the sections named accordingly.

As the JSON format is not primarily targeting human readers but more programs parsing, validating and transforming no example is given in this introduction but instead examples derived from several real-world security advisories are stated in the non-normative Appendix E Complete Examples.

## 2.1 Construction Principles
A Security Advisory defined as a CSAF document is the result of complex orchestration of many players and distinct and partially difficult to play schemas.

The format chosen is [JSONSchema] which allows validation and delegation to sub schema providers. The latter aligns well with separation of concerns and shares the format family of information interchange utilized by the providers of product and vulnerability information which migrated from XML to JSON since the creation of CSAF CVRF version 1.2, the predecessor of this specification.

The acronym CSAF, âCommon Security Advisory Frameworkâ, stands for the target of concerted mitigation and remediation accomplishment.

Technically the use of JSON schema allows validation and proof of model conformance (through established schema based validation) of the declared information inside CSAF documents.

The CSAF schema structures its derived documents into three main classes of the information conveyed:

1. The frame, aggregation, and reference information of the document
2. Product information considered relevant by the creator
3. Vulnerability information and its relation to the products declared in 2.

Wherever possible repetition of data has been replaced by linkage through ID elements. Consistency on the content level thus is in the responsibility of the producer of such documents, to link e.g. vulnerability information to the matching product.

A dictionary like presentation of all defined schema elements is given in the section SCHEMASECTIONNUMBER Schema. Any expected relations to other elements (linkage) is described there. This linking relies on setting attribute values accordingly (mostly guided by industry best practice and conventions) and thus implies, that any deep validation on a semantic level is to be ensured by the producer and consumer of CSAF documents. It is out of scope for this specification.

Proven and intended usage patterns from practice are given where possible. 

Delegation to industry best practices technologies is used in referencing schemas for:

* Platform Data:
  * Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Version 2.3 [CPE23_A]
* Vulnerability Scoring:
  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.1 [CVSS3_1]
    * JSON Schema Reference https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.json
  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.0 [CVSS3]
    * JSON Schema Reference https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.0.json
  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 2.0 [CVSS2][1]
    * JSON Schema Reference https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v2.0.json
* Classfication for Document Distribution
  * Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)
    * Default Definition: https://www.first.org/tlp/

# 3 Safety, Security, and Data Protection Considerations
(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.

-------

# 4 Conformance
(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).

See "Guidelines to Writing Conformance Clauses":
