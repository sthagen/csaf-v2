# 1 Introduction

The text in this section may all be replaced, but the following three sections (1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) are required for OASIS publications. Section 1.1 (IPR Policy) must not be changed by the TC. Section 1.2 (Terminology) may be modified to include other terminology-related information used in this specification. Section 1.3 (Normative References) should be modified to include additional references, as needed. Section 1.4 (Non-Normative References) is not required, but should be modified to include additional references, as needed.

Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named prose/csaf-v2-editor-draft.md):

    $ pandoc -f gfm -t html prose/csaf-v2-editor-draft.md -c static/styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3-patched.css \
    --toc --toc-depth=4 -s -o csaf.html --metadata title="CSAF Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework Version 2.0"

OASIS staff are currently using pandoc 2.6 from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.6.

This also requires the presence of a .css file containing the HTML styles (like styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3-patched.css).

Fixes in the css (shall) address:
* blockquotes shall maintain constant indentation
* code blocks shall expose block rectangle (not per line width right margin) - still unpatched
* Logo and title page shall not be within the table of content (manually removal required currently - maybe addressable by processor options or markup changes)

Note this command generates a Table of Contents (TOC) in HTML which is located at the top of the HTML document, and which requires additional editing in order to be published in the expected OASIS style. This editing will be handled by OASIS staff during publication.
A TC may use other ways to generate HTML from markdown, which may generate a TOC in a different way.

## 1.1 IPR Policy
This specification is provided under the [Non-Assertion](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode) Mode of the [OASIS IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established. For information on whether any patents have been disclosed that may be essential to implementing this specification, and any offers of patent licensing terms, please refer to the Intellectual Property Rights section of the TC's web page ([https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php)).

## 1.2 Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)] and [[RFC8174](#rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

For purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply:

**advisory**: reporting item that describes a condition present in an artifact and that requires action by the consumers

**advisory document**: artifact in which an analysis tool reports a result

**advisory management system**: software system that consumes the documents produced by analysis tools, produces advisories that enable engineering ad operating organizations to assess the quality of these software artifacts at a point in time, and performs functions such as filing security advisories and displaying information about individual advisories.  **Note**: An advisory management system can interact with a document viewer to display information about individual advisories.

**advisory matching**: process of determining whether two advisories are targeting the same products and conditions

**artifact**: sequence of bytes addressable via a URI.  _Examples_: A physical file in a file system such as a source file, an object file, a configuration file or a data file; a specific version of a file in a version control system; a database table accessed via an HTTP request; an arbitrary stream of bytes returned from an HTTP request, a product URL, a common product enumeration value.

**converter**: CSAF producer that transforms the output of an analysis tool from its native output format into the CSAF format

**CSAF consumer**: program that reads and interprets a CSAF document

**CSAF document**: document in the format defined by this document

**CSAF post-processor**: CSAF producer that transforms an existing CSAF document into a new CSAF document, for example, by removing or redacting elements according to sharing policies.

**CSAF producer**: program that emits output in the CSAF format

**direct producer**: analysis tool which acts as a CSAF producer

**document**: output file produced by an analysis tool, which enumerates the results produced by the tool

**(document) viewer**: CSAF consumer that reads a document, displays a list of the results it contains, and allows an end user to view each result in the context of the artifact in which it occurs

**driver**: tool component containing an analysis toolâs or converterâs primary executable, which controls the toolâs or converterâs execution, and which in the case of an analysis tool typically defines a set of analysis rules

**embedded link**: syntactic construct which enables a message string to refer to a location mentioned in the document

**empty array**: array that contains no elements, and so has a length of 0

**empty object**: object that contains no properties

**empty string**: string that contains no characters, and so has a length of 0

**(end) user**: person who uses the information in a document to investigate, triage, or resolve results

**engineering system**: software analysis environment within which analysis tools execute.  **Note**: An engineering system might include a build system, a source control system, a result management system, a bug tracking system, a test execution system, and so on.

**extension**: tool component other than the driver (for example, a plugin, a configuration file, or a taxonomy)

**external property file**: file containing the values of one or more externalized properties

**externalizable property**: property that can be contained in an external property file

**externalized property**: property stored outside of the CSAF document to which it logically belongs

**false positive**: result which an end user decides does not actually represent a problem

**fingerprint**: stable value that can be used by a result management system to uniquely identify a result over time, even if a relevant artifact is modified

**formatted message**: message string which contains formatting information such as Markdown formatting characters

**fully qualified logical name**: string that fully identifies the programmatic construct specified by a logical location, typically by means of a hierarchical identifier.

**hierarchical string**: string in the format &lt;component>{/&lt;component>}*

**line**: contiguous sequence of characters, starting either at the beginning of an artifact or immediately after a newline sequence, and ending at and including the nearest subsequent newline sequence, if one is present, or else extending to the end of the artifact

**line (number)**: 1-based index of a line within a file.  **Note**: Abbreviated to "line" when there is no danger of ambiguity with "line" in the sense of a sequence of characters.

**localizable**: subject to being translated from one natural language to another

**message string**: human-readable string that conveys information relevant to an element in a CSAF document

**nested artifact**: artifact that is contained within another artifact

**newline sequence**: sequence of one or more characters representing the end of a line of text.  **Note**: Some systems represent a newline sequence with a single newline character; others represent it as a carriage return character followed by a newline character.

**notification**: reporting item that describes a condition encountered by a tool during its execution

**opaque**: neither human-readable nor machine-parsable into constituent parts

**parent (artifact)**: artifact which contains one or more nested artifacts

**plain text message**: message string which does not contain any formatting information

**plugin**: tool component that defines additional rules

**policy**: set of rule configurations that specify how results that violate the rules defined by a particular tool component are to be treated

**problem**: result which indicates a condition that has the potential to detract from the quality of the program.  _Examples_: A security vulnerability, a deviation from contractual or legal requirements.

**property**: attribute of an object consisting of a name and a value associated with the name

**redactable property**: property that potentially contains sensitive information that a CSAF direct producer or a CSAF post-processor might wish to redact

**reporting item**: unit of output produced by a tool, either a result or a notification

**reporting configuration**: the subset of reporting metadata that a tool can configure at runtime, before performing its scan.  _Examples_: severity level, rank

**repository** container for a related set of files in a version control system

**taxonomy**: classification of analysis results into a set of categories

**tag**: string that conveys additional information about the CSAF document element to which it applies

**text artifact**: artifact considered as a sequence of characters organized into lines and columns

**text region**: region representing a contiguous range of zero or more characters in a text artifact

**tool component**: component of an analysis tool or converter, either its driver or an extension, consisting of one or more files

**top-level artifact**: artifact which is not contained within any other artifact

**translation**: rendering of a tool component's localizable strings into another language

**triage**: decide whether a result indicates a problem that needs to be corrected

**user**: see end user.

## 1.5 Typographical Conventions
Keywords defined by this specification use this `monospaced` font.
```
    Normative source code uses this paragraph style.
```
Text following the special symbol (Â«) â an opening Guillemet (or French quotation mark) â within this specification identifies conformance statements. Every conformance statement is separated from the following text with the special end symbol (Â») â a closing Guillemet, and has been assigned a reference that follows that end symbol in the format [CSAF-section#-local#].

Some sections of this specification are illustrated with non-normative examples introduced with "Example" or "Examples" like so:

*Examples:*
```
    Non-normative examples also use this paragraph style but preceded by the text "Example(s).
```

All examples in this document are non-normative and informative only.

All other text is normative unless otherwise labeled e.g. like:

Non-normative Comment:

>This is a pure informative comment that may be present, because the information conveyed is deemed useful advice or common pitfalls learned from implementer or operator experience and often given including the rationale.

-------

# 2 Design Considerations
The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) is a language to exchange Security Advisories formulated in JSON.

Non-normative comment:

>The term Security Advisory as used in this document describes any notification of security issues in products of and by providers. Anyone providing a product is considered in this document as a vendor, i.e. developers or maintainers of information system products or services. This includes all authoritative product vendors, Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs), and product resellers and distributors, including authoritative vendor partners.
A security issue is not necessarily constraint to a problem statement, the focus of the term is on the security aspect impacting (or not impacting) specific product-platform-version combinations. Information on presence or absence of work-arounds is also considered part of the security issue.
This document is the definitive reference for the language elements of CSAF version 2.0. The encompassing JSON schema file noted in the Additional Artifacts section of the title page shall be taken as normative in the case a gap or an inconsistency in this explanatory document becomes evident.
The following presentation in this section is grouped by topical area, and is not simply derivative documentation from the schema document itself. The information contained aims to be more descriptive and complete. Where applicable, common conventions are stated and known common issues in usage are pointed out informatively to support implementers of document producers and consumers alike. The section SCHEMA_SECTION_NUMBER Schema derives from the JSON schema itself as a service for the reader.

Â« From a high-level perspective, any Security Advisory purported by a CSAF version 2.0 adhering JSON text document MUST provide the `document` member with at least the following five properties defined: `csaf_version`, `title`, `publisher`, `type`, and `tracking`. Â» [CSAF-2-1]

This minimal required information set does not provide any useful information on products, vulnerabilities, or security advisories. Thus, any real-world Security Advisory will carry additional information as specified in SCHEMA_SECTION_NUMBER section Schema.

Care has been taken, to design the containers for product and vulnerability information to support fine-grained mapping of security advisories onto product and vulnerability and minimize data duplication through referencing.
The display of the elements representing Product Tree and Vulnerability information has been placed in the sections named accordingly.

As the JSON format is not primarily targeting human readers but more programs parsing, validating and transforming no example is given in this introduction but instead examples derived from several real-world security advisories are stated in the non-normative Appendix E Complete Examples.

## 2.1 Construction Principles
A Security Advisory defined as a CSAF document is the result of complex orchestration of many players and distinct and partially difficult to play schemas.

The format chosen is [JSONSchema] which allows validation and delegation to sub schema providers. The latter aligns well with separation of concerns and shares the format family of information interchange utilized by the providers of product and vulnerability information which migrated from XML to JSON since the creation of CSAF CVRF version 1.2, the predecessor of this specification.

The acronym CSAF, âCommon Security Advisory Frameworkâ, stands for the target of concerted mitigation and remediation accomplishment.

Technically the use of JSON schema allows validation and proof of model conformance (through established schema based validation) of the declared information inside CSAF documents.

The CSAF schema structures its derived documents into three main classes of the information conveyed:

1. The frame, aggregation, and reference information of the document
2. Product information considered relevant by the creator
3. Vulnerability information and its relation to the products declared in 2.

Wherever possible repetition of data has been replaced by linkage through ID elements. Consistency on the content level thus is in the responsibility of the producer of such documents, to link e.g. vulnerability information to the matching product.

A dictionary like presentation of all defined schema elements is given in the section SCHEMASECTIONNUMBER Schema. Any expected relations to other elements (linkage) is described there. This linking relies on setting attribute values accordingly (mostly guided by industry best practice and conventions) and thus implies, that any deep validation on a semantic level is to be ensured by the producer and consumer of CSAF documents. It is out of scope for this specification.

Proven and intended usage patterns from practice are given where possible. 

Delegation to industry best practices technologies is used in referencing schemas for:

* Platform Data:
  * Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Version 2.3 [CPE23_A]

# 3 Schema Elements

The CSAF schema describes how to represent security advisory information as a JSON document.

The CSAF schema Version 2.0 builds on the JSON Schema draft 2019-09 rules.

    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema"

The schema identifier is (before publication):

    "$id": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/master/csaf_2.0/json_schema/csaf_json_schema.json"

The further documentation of the schema is organized via Definitions and Properties. 

* Definitions provide types that extend the JSON schema model 
* Properties use these types to support assembling security advisories

Types and properties together provide the vocabulary for the domain specific language supporting security advisories. 

The single mandatory property is `document`. 
The optional two additional properties are `product_tree` and `vulnerabilities`.

## 3.1 Definitions
The definitions (`$defs`) introduce the following domain specific types into the CSAF language: 
Acknowledgement (`acknowledgement_t`), Branch Branches (`branch_branches_t`), Full Product Name (`full_product_name_t`), Language (`lang_t`), Notes (`notes_t`), Products (`products_t`), Product Groups (`product_groups_t`), Product Group ID (`product_group_id_t`), Product ID (`product_id_t`), References (`references_t`), and Version (`version_t`).  

    "$defs": {
        "acknowledgment_t": {
            // ...
        },
        "branch_branches_t": {
            // ...

##### 3.2.1.11.3 Document Property - Tracking - Current Release Date

Current release date (`current_release_date`) with value type `string` and format `date-time` holds the date when the current revision of this document was released.


##### 3.2.1.11.4 Document Property - Tracking - Generator

Document Generator (`generator`) of value type `object` with mandatory property Engine (`engine`) and optional property Date (`date`) s a container to hold all elements related to the generation of the document. These items will reference when the document was actually created, including the date it was generated and the entity that generated it.. 

        "generator": {
          // ...
          "properties": {
            "engine": {
              // ...
            },
            "date": {
              // ...
            }
          }
        },

Engine of document generation (`engine`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters SHOULD represent the name of the engine that generated the CSAF document, and MAY additionally refer to its version.

Examples:

    TVCE
    Red Hat rhsa-to-cvrf 2.1
    CMPFA Core Converter CVRF->CSAF Version 0.6


Date of document generation (`date`) of value type `string` with format `date-time` SHOULD be the current date that the document was generated. 
Because documents are often generated internally by a document producer and exist for a nonzero amount of time before being released, this field MAY be different from the Initial Release Date and Current Release Date.

##### 3.2.1.11.5 Document Property - Tracking - Initial Release Date

Initial release date (`initial_release_date`) with value type `string` and format `date-time` holds the date when this document was first published.

##### 3.2.1.11.6 Document Property - Tracking - Revision History

The Revision History (`revision_history`) with value type `array` of 1 or more Revision History Entries contains all the information elements required to track the evolution of a CSAF document. 

        "revision_history": {
          // ...
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "number": {
                // ...
              },
              "date": {
                // ...
              },
              "description": {
                // ...
              }
            }
          }
        },

Revision History Entry items are of type object with the three mandatory properties: Number (`number`), Date (`date`), and Description (`description`). 

The Number (`number`) has value type Version (`version_t`). 

The Date of the revision (`date`) of value type `string` with format `date-time` states the date of the revision entry.

The Description  of the revision (`description`) of value type `string` with 1 or more characters holds a single non-empty string representing a short description of the changes.

##### 3.2.1.11.7 Document Property - Tracking - Status

Document status (`status`) defines the draft status of the document. Value type is string with fixed value set (enum). The value MUST be one of the following:

    draft
    final
    interim

##### 3.2.1.11.8 Document Property - Tracking - Version

Version has the value type Version (`version_t`).

#### 3.2.1.12 Document Property - Type
Document type (`type`) with value type `string` of 1 or more characters defines a short canonical name, chosen by the document producer, which will inform the end user as to the type of document.

    "type": {
      // ...
    }

Examples:

    Security Advisory
    Security Notice
    Vulnerability Report

# 4 Safety, Security, and Data Protection Considerations
For security reasons, CSAF producers and consumers SHALL adhere to the following:
* CSAF producers SHALL NOT emit messages that contain HTML, even though all variants of Markdown permit it.
* Deeply nested markup can cause a stack overflow in the Markdown processor [GFMENG]. To reduce this risk, CSAF consumers SHALL use a Markdown processor that is hardened against such attacks.
  **Note**: One example is the GitHub fork of the cmark Markdown processor [GFMCMARK].
* To reduce the risk posed by possibly malicious CSAF files that do contain arbitrary HTML (including, for example, javascript: links), CSAF consumers SHALL either disable HTML processing (for example, by using an option such as the --safe option in the cmark Markdown processor) or run the resulting HTML through an HTML sanitizer.
CSAF consumers that are not prepared to deal with the security implications of formatted messages SHALL NOT attempt to render them and SHALL instead fall back to the corresponding plain text messages.


(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.

# 5 Conformance
## 5.1 Conformance Targets
This document defines requirements for the CSAF file format and for certain software components that interact with it. The entities ("conformance targets") for which this document defines requirements are:
* **CSAF document**: A security advisory text document in the format defined by this document.
* **CSAF producer**: A program which emits output in the CSAF format.
* **Direct producer**: An analysis tool which acts as a CSAF producer.
* **Converter**: A CSAF producer that transforms the output of an analysis tool from its native output format into the CSAF format.
* **CSAF post-processor**: A CSAF producer that transforms an existing CSAF document into a new CSAF document, for example, by removing or redacting security-sensitive elements.
* **CSAF consumer**: A program that reads and interprets a CSAF document.
* **Viewer**: A CSAF consumer that reads a CSAF document, displays a list of the results it contains, and allows an end user to view each result in the context of the artifact in which it occurs.
* **Result management system**: A software system that consumes the documents produced by analysis tools, produces reports that enable engineering teams to assess the quality of their software artifacts at a point in time and to observe trends in the quality over time, and performs functions such as filing bugs and displaying information about individual results.
* **Engineering system**: A software development environment within which analysis tools execute. It might include a build system, a source control system, a result management system, a bug tracking system, a test execution system, and so on.
The normative content in this document defines requirements for CSAF documents, except for those normative requirements that are explicitly designated as defining the behavior of another conformance target.

## 5.2 Conformance Clause 1: CSAF document
A text file satisfies the "CSAF document"â" conformance profile if:
* It conforms to the syntax and semantics defined in section 3.

## 5.3 Conformance Clause 2: CSAF producer
A program satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile if:
* It produces output in the CSAF format, according to the semantics defined in section 3.
* It satisfies those normative requirements in section 3 that are designated as applying to CSAF producers.

## 5.4 Conformance Clause 3: Direct producer
An analysis tool satisfies the "Direct producer" conformance profile if:
* It satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* It additionally satisfies those normative requirements in section 3 that are designated as applying to "direct producers" or to "analysis tools".
* It does not emit any objects, properties, or values which, according to section 3, are intended to be produced only by converters.

## 5.5 Conformance Clause 4: Converter
A converter satisfies the âConverterâ conformance profile if:
* It satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* It additionally satisfies those normative requirements in section 3 that are designated as applying to converters.
* It does not emit any objects, properties, or values which, according to section 3, are intended to be produced only by direct producers.

## 5.6 Conformance Clause 5: CSAF post-processor
A CSAF post-processor satisfies the "CSAF post-processor" conformance profile if:
* It satisfies the "CSAF consumer" conformance profile.
* It satisfies the "CSAF producer" conformance profile.
* It additionally satisfies those normative requirements in section 3 that are designated as applying to post-processors.

## 5.7 Conformance Clause 6: CSAF consumer
A consumer satisfies the "CSAF consumer" conformance profile if:
* It reads CSAF documents and interprets them according to the semantics defined in section 3.
* It satisfies those normative requirements in section 3 that are designated as applying to CSAF consumers.

## 5.8 Conformance Clause 7: Viewer
A viewer satisfies the "viewer" conformance profile if:
* It satisfies the "CSAF consumer" conformance profile.
* It additionally satisfies the normative requirements in section 3 that are designated as applying to viewers.

## 5.9 Conformance Clause 8: Result management system
A result management system satisfies the "result management system" conformance profile if:
* It satisfies the "CSAF consumer" conformance profile.
* It additionally satisfies the normative requirements in section 3 and Appendix B ("Use of fingerprints by result management systems") that are designated as applying to result management systems.

## 5.10 Conformance Clause 9: Engineering system
An engineering system satisfies the "engineering system" conformance profile if:
* It satisfies the normative requirements in section 3 that are designated as applying to engineering systems.

(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).
